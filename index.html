          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Disability, Design, and the Web (DESMA171) is a studio-based course that provides an introduction to 
            universal design, assistive technology, and disability justice. Students will work hands-on in 
            partnership with community organizations that support people with disabilities to learn about assistive 
            technology, identify access issues, and prototype solutions on the web. We will engage with and expand 
            on existing accessibility best practices to interrogate art and design’s role in understanding 
            accessibility and disability. Throughout the course, students will learn and employ a human-centered 
            approach to begin creating more inclusive web experiences. Partner organizations we will work with 
            include Repair, Jazz Hands for Autism, Autism LA, and the LA Spoonie Collective.
          </p>

          <h3>Expectations</h3>
          <h4 class='label'>Grading</h4>
          Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
          <ul>
            <li>Exercises and assignments 40%</li>
            <li>Mid-term presentation 10%</li>
            <li>Final project 20%</li>
            <li>Final project documentation 10%</li>
            <li>Participation 20%</li>
          </ul>
          
          Project grades take into account:
          <ul style='margin-bottom:2em'>
            <li>Demonstrated understanding of accessibility design principles and practices</li>
            <li>Engagement with community collaborators</li>
            <li>Conceptual, technical, and visual development</li>
            <li>Rigor and creativity</li>
            <li>Note: Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 class='label'>Projects</h4>
          <p>This course will be structured around quarter-long group projects working collaboratively with local 
            disability organizations Autism LA, Jazz Hands for Autism, and Repair. Students will be divided into 
            groups to work together to address different needs of these organizations, including media creation, 
            design, web development, and accessibility testing. Over the 10 weeks, we will move through a process 
            of research, prototyping, design, development, testing, and documentation. This work will be guided by 
            regular feedback from community partners and in-class reviews. A series of shorter exercises introducing 
            accessibility and disability concepts will supplement this work.</p>
      
          
          <h4 class='label'>Assignments</h4>
          <p>All projects and homework should be turned in via the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/118z3usKIGVyFDnUbW2iVRjnSndSHCur5FRfKnPke7rA/edit#gid=0' target='_blank'>assignments spreadsheet</a> by 2pm on the day it is due.
            If you are absent from class you are still expected to turn in your work via the spreadsheet. If you are unable to complete the work on time, please contact the instructors.
            Extensions may be issued for reasonable circumstances. If an extension has not been approved and the work is late, the instructors will determine a new deadline and the work will receive a
            one letter grade deduction.
          </p>

          <h4 class='label'>Participation</h4>
          <p>Participation is critical to passing and enjoying this class.
            Do the work, share your thoughts, ask questions, prepare for meetings, offer feedback during critiques.
            This class is meant to be a safe space in which you feel encouraged and supported in learning and taking 
            creative risks. This means being aware and considerate of different backgrounds, perspectives, and 
            identities. Respect each other and this space we are building together. Don’t assume. Try to remain open 
            to learning at all times. Help each other in this. If there are concerns please let an instructor or
            the TA know.
          </p>
          
          <h4 class='label'>Attendance</h4>
          <p>Attendance and clear communication is essential. If you are not able to attend class or a group meeting, 
            please communicate with the instructors and group members (in advance whenever possible). Unexcused 
            absences or tardies will result in a reduced participation grade.</p>

          <h3>Commitment to Diversity and Safer Spaces</h3>
          <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, 
            and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace 
            the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, 
            respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, 
            however our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely 
            important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while 
            others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or 
            vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students, TA, and instructor 
            is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment 
            creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the 
            group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for 
            us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively if you feel that something said in discussion or 
            included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the instructor or TA.

          <h3>Disability Services</h3>
          <p>UCLA strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience 
            academic barriers based on a disability, please let me know as soon as possible. It is necessary for you 
            to register with the <a href='http://www.cae.ucla.edu/'>UCLA Center for Accessible Education</a> so that 
            we can establish reasonable accommodations. After registration, make arrangements with me to discuss how 
            to implement these accommodations.</p>

          <h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>
          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles occupies the ancestral, traditional, and contemporary Lands of 
            the Tongva and Chumash peoples. Our ability to gather and learn here is the result of coercion, 
            dispossession, and colonization. We are grateful for the land itself and the people that have stewarded it 
            through generations. While a land acknowledgment is not enough, it is first step in the work toward 
            supporting decolonial and indigenous movements for sovereignty and self-determination.
